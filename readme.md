## Inspiration

I have written this script in many different languages from Bash, to Bash, to 
Python, and now JavaScript. I prefer JavaScript as a language, so this is the
version I chose to publish.

The main reason for writing this script is for renaming file extensions to 
lower-case. This mostly stems from cameras and the common behavior of saving
file names with all upper-case extensions. Although, Windows does not care,
Linux does, and so does any photo libraries like Google Photos. Therefore,
I wrote this script to make the batch renaming of files quick and easy.
